Beginners can clone this repository and start working on it.

Requirements & Things to do:-

1.) You have to install Node and NPM on your system only.
2.) Clone my repository in a folder.
3.) Run a command on terminal "npm install".
4.) It will automatically install packages which are in package.json file.
5.) I have used PORT 8080, so you have to simply run on browser "http://localhost:8080"
6.) You can change the PORT in web.config.js file.
